m92-pi 1.1.0 - Bare-metal Irem M92 and M90 emulator for Raspberry Pi 3 and 4
============================================================================

WHAT'S NEW IN 1.1.0

  - Irem M90 games: Bomber Man / Dynablaster / Atomic Punk, Bomber Man
    World / New Atomic Punk, Risky Challenge / Gussun Oyoyo. Up to 4
    players in the Bomber Man games (Cabinet in DIP SWITCHES).
  - Player 3 or 4 can now open the in-game menu and use it.
  - The EEPROM of Major Title 2 and The Irem Skins Game is written to
    the card only when it has changed.
  - Every line of m92pi/list.txt gives the region too.
  - Fixed some bugs and aligned the code shared with the other projects
    (neo-pi, nes-pi).
  - To update a card, copy the new files over the old ones: games,
    saves, hiscores, settings and pads.cfg in m92pi are kept and work
    as before.

SET-UP

  1. Use a microSD card formatted as FAT32, with a standard partition
     table.
  2. Copy EVERYTHING in this folder to the card's root.
  3. Put your M92 and M90 games in the m92pi folder as MAME ROM sets, one
     .zip per set with MAME's file name (uccops.zip, hook.zip,
     dynablst.zip...). A clone also needs its parent's zip (uccopsj.zip
     needs uccops.zip).
     ROMs are identified by CRC, so sets from other MAME versions work.
  4. Connect a USB gamepad and the display (on a Pi 4, HDMI 0, next to the
     power socket). Insert the card and switch on.

START-UP

  - The screen stays black briefly, then the game list appears.
  - With only one game in m92pi, the list is skipped and the game starts
    at once. GAME LIST in the in-game menu still opens the list.
  - Game list: Up/Down to choose, Left/Right to jump by 8, A or Start to
    play, D for OPTIONS. Bottom left: the MAME set name and region.
  - Names in the list: m92pi/list.txt, one line per set, as
    set=Title|Region. Sets not listed there use MAME's name and region.
  - Benchmark: an empty file named m92pi/BENCH (no extension) runs one on
    the selected game before normal play: 30 seconds of the game's demo,
    then 60 seconds measured. Do not touch anything. Results in
    m92pi/BENCH.TXT and m92pi/PROFILE.TXT. Delete BENCH to start normally.
  - Multicore check: an empty file named m92pi/MCTEST checks, on the
    selected game, that the picture drawn on several CPU cores is
    identical to the one drawn on a single core (four runs of 60 seconds).
    Results in m92pi/MCTEST.TXT. Delete MCTEST to start normally.

SETTING UP THE CONTROLS

  The first time a pad model is connected, the CONTROLS screen opens by
  itself. Press the button you want for each function, in this order: A,
  B, C, D, E, F, SELECT/COIN, START. The games use A and B; C, D, E and F
  are used only by Superior / Perfect Soldiers. After the last one, the
  set-up is saved (SAVED).

  Directions need no set-up: the d-pad, hat and left stick always work. A
  button already assigned is ignored. On a keyboard, Esc cancels.

  The set-up applies to every pad of the same model and is stored in
  m92pi/pads.cfg. To redo it: OPTIONS (D in the game list) > CONTROLS.

CONTROLS IN GAME

  D-pad or left stick       Joystick
  A, B                      Buttons 1 and 2 (the games use two buttons)
  C, D, E, F                Buttons 3 to 6, only for Superior / Perfect
                            Soldiers (A B C punches, D E F kicks)
  Start                     Start
  Select (short press)      Insert a coin
  Select held 1 second      In-game menu (the game pauses)
  Select + A                Screenshot: m92pi/shots/<game>_NNN.png
  Select + B                Lazy finger on/off: held, A to F fire
                            repeatedly (per player)
  Select + C                Status line on/off
  Select + D                Credits (B closes them)

  Pads become players 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the order they are connected. For 3
  or 4 players, games with a Cabinet switch need it set for 3 or 4
  players in DIP SWITCHES.

IN-GAME MENU (hold Select for 1 second; B resumes the game)

  SAVE STATE    Save the game (one save per game).
  LOAD STATE    Load it (available once a save has been made).
  DIP SWITCHES  The board's switches (difficulty, lives, coinage,
                cabinet...). A or Left/Right changes, B goes back. Many
                games read them only at start-up: SOME APPLY AFTER RESET.
                Saved per game.
  OPTIONS       The OPTIONS menu, over the paused game; B comes back here.
  RESET         Restart the game.
  GAME LIST     Back to the game list.
  POWER OFF     3-second countdown (B cancels). Everything is saved, then
                picture and sound are switched off: you can unplug the
                power.

OPTIONS MENU (D in the game list, or from the in-game menu)

  A or Left/Right changes a setting, B goes back. Settings are stored in
  m92pi/m92pi.cfg.

  CPU SPEED     NORMAL: the original speed. TURBO: 2.2 times faster (on
                the M92, 20 MHz instead of 9): less slowdown where the
                original hardware slows down. Some games may behave
                differently; NORMAL is the accurate setting. On a Pi 3,
                TURBO may slow down the heaviest games.
  SCANLINES     OFF / LIGHT / MEDIUM / STRONG / COMPOSITE. COMPOSITE has no
                scanlines: blargg's NTSC filter gives the look of a
                composite video connection of the time. Each line is
                filtered as soon as it is drawn, on its own CPU core: no
                added lag.
  CONTROLS      Set up a pad (with several pads, press a button on the one
                to set up).
  POWER OFF     As in the in-game menu.

STATUS LINE (Select + C)

  Below the picture, or in the left black column at 720p:

    60 FPS   LOAD 62%   39 C   DLY 6.5   1080P 4X CPU+HVS

  - LOAD: how much of each frame is used (green; yellow from 75%; red
    above 95%).
  - DLY: the frame delay in ms. With beam racing, RACE instead: the ms
    from reading the pads to sending the top of the picture to the TV.

LOW INPUT LAG

  Each frame starts with the vertical blank, when the games read the pads,
  then draws the picture: the next frame shown already answers the pads.
  No run-ahead.

  Frame delay: the frame starts a few ms after vsync, so the pads are read
  later. It is automatic (0 to 6 ms) and drops at once if the game gets
  heavier.

  Beam racing: the picture is drawn line by line just ahead of the HDMI
  output, as the original board draws it on a CRT. At start-up m92-pi
  measures the Pi's video scaler for about a second. If lines are late
  too often, that game goes back to double buffering + frame delay
  (LOG.TXT says so); the next game started from the list tries again.

  The M92 and M90 run at 60.01 Hz: on a 60 Hz TV, one frame in about
  100 seconds is repeated or skipped.

PIXEL PERFECT

  Integer scaling only (square pixels, never stretched), with black
  borders. 1080p: 1280x960 picture. 720p: 960x720 picture.

TESTING OPTIONS (in m92pi/m92pi.cfg, one per line)

    beamracing=off   Double buffering + frame delay (more input lag)
    framedelay=off   No frame delay
    framedelay=5     Fixed delay in ms (1 to 12; too much causes stutter)
    scaler=cpu       No hardware scaler (slower)
    multicore=off    Everything on one CPU core (slower)
    usbpoll=500      Poll pads every 2 ms instead of every 1 ms (1000 Hz)
    usbpoll=250      Every 4 ms
    usbpoll=native   At the rate the pad asks for (usually every 8-10 ms)

  If a pad misbehaves (double or missed presses, disconnects), try
  usbpoll=500, then usbpoll=250.

FILES ON THE CARD (m92pi folder)

  list.txt       Names shown in the game list
  LOG.TXT        Diagnostics: model, HDMI, pads, audio, per-minute
                 timings. Updated when the menu opens, when the game
                 changes and at power-off
  BENCH.TXT      Benchmark results
  PROFILE.TXT    Benchmark: where the time goes (for the developer)
  MCTEST.TXT     Multicore check results
  shots/         Screenshots (Select + A)
  saves/         Save states (.st1), DIP switches (.dip), EEPROM (.nv),
                 hiscores (.hi, MAME's format)
  LAST.TXT       Last game played (the list starts there)
  m92pi.cfg      OPTIONS settings
  pads.cfg       Controls for each pad model

  Always switch off with POWER OFF: it saves settings, save data, hiscores
  and LOG.TXT. For help, LOG.TXT and BENCH.TXT are all that is needed.

IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

  The green LED blinks a number of times, repeatedly:
  2 = HDMI   3 = SD card   5 = no game   6 = emulator   7 = memory

  A game that cannot be loaded (a ROM missing, for example) shows CANNOT
  LOAD GAME, then the list again; LOG.TXT names the missing ROM.

  No picture at all: put a # in front of hdmi_group and hdmi_mode in
  config.txt.
